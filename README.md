About The Project
I'm starting from nothing trying to figure out away to use AI to help with ADHD and Autism

About Me
Hello, I'm David, a Technician with a passion for Problem solving , Design and Technology . With 20 years of experience in Mechanic/Technician, I've developed a keen interest in Machine Learning.

Background
With a few semesters of Art in Community College and 2 years Technical training in automotive, I've pushed myself through many hurdles and am looking for a way to help others who might struggle from the same.
Interests
Outside of my day job fixing trains, I immerse myself in Generative AI and Graphic Design. I'm particularly fascinated by Machine Learning and Text Based AI, which drives me to continuously explore and learn.

My Goals with This Project
This project is a culmination of my interests in helping myself and others hopefully through an AI based app to aid in the struggles associated with ADHD and Autism. My goals are to:

[Goal 1: e.g., solve a specific problem, learn a new skill, contribute to the community]
[Goal 2: e.g., create a tool that others can use, deepen my understanding of a specific technology]
[Goal 3: e.g., collaborate with others, share knowledge]
Connect with Me
I love connecting with fellow [professionals, enthusiasts, learners] in the [specific field or general technology] community. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.] at [provide your handle or link].
